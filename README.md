# minirogue
A tiny roguelike game to learn Rust, Bevy and ECS.
Does not work yet.

It will have two releases:
  - a binary+source FOSS release, with TBD free/CC assets, and
  - a binary proprietary release, with CanariGames's unfree [CanariPack 1BIT TopDown](https://canarigames.itch.io/canaripack-1bit-topdown) assets.
